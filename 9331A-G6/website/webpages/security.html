		 <p class="lead">
        Injection occurs when there is an untrusted data which is sent as a part of a command or a query.
		Attackers use this to let the interpreter execute a certain command without proper authorization and is not really part of the
		original functionality of the application. Injections can be found on SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers  and others. 
		It can result to data loss, financial loss, denial of access and others.

        Authentication and session management goes hand in hand because they handle both the verifying of user accounts and the management of the active sessions.
		The authentication part is critical yet it has flaws on the part of credential management like change password.
On the web, user authentication usually require userID or username and password.
 There are stronger authentication and verification protocols/procedures like biometrics or when you need your thumbprint or fingerprint before you can access your account.
 There are also cases wherein you are required to prove that you are not a robot and this is also a verification protocol.

 Bank account informations, health information, birthdays, username, and password are only some of many informations that are stored within the database of a web application. 
 These are considered to be sensitive data and needs to be secured properly so that no one can use these informations in a harmful way. But what if these data were not secured properly, 
 this is where sensitive data exposure comes in. Sensitive data exposure is a kind of vulnerability where a hacker can simply have the access to monitor the network traffic and use the users session cookies in order to access 
 their sensitive data. In this way, hackers can now use the information which can lead to financial loss and other issues.
